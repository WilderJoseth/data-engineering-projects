# On-Premise Projects

This section contains projects focused on **on-premise data engineering workflows**, where data processing is performed using local or self-managed infrastructure ‚Äî typically **Microsoft SQL Server** and **Python-based ETL scripts**.

These projects simulate realistic enterprise scenarios where on-prem systems serve as data sources or destinations before cloud migration.

## Technologies involved

* Python: data ingestion, transformation, and loading (ETL).
* Pandas / pyodbc / SQLAlchemy: for data manipulation and SQL Server connectivity.
* Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL): target database for staging and analytical tables.
* T-SQL: data validation, indexing, and optimization.
* Power BI (optional): reporting layer for validation and exploration.
