# Data engineering projects

This repository is a **technical portfolio** and **learning space** where I document real data engineering workflows I've built using:
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**
- **Databricks / Delta Lake**
- **Microsoft SQL Server (On-Premise)**

It serves two purposes:
1. **For recruiters and peers** ‚Äî to showcase my hands-on experience building data pipelines, performing migrations, and optimizing data architectures on modern cloud platforms.  
2. **For learners** ‚Äî to provide clear, reproducible examples of data engineering patterns, including ingestion, transformation, and performance tuning.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **/zure_synapse/** | Projects using Azure Synapse (Serverless/Dedicated), with examples of external tables, CTAS, and `COPY INTO` for initial loads and incremental ingestion. Some follow the **Medallion Architecture** pattern (bronze/silver/gold). |
| **/databricks/** | Notebooks demonstrating Delta Lake pipelines, transformations with PySpark, and cost/performance experiments (Delta optimization, caching, partitioning). |
| **/on_premise/** | Legacy or hybrid SQL Server workloads showing incremental loads, historical data management, and CDC strategies before cloud migration. |

> Each folder contains standalone projects ‚Äî some fully orchestrated (ADF/Synapse), others exploratory or educational (notebooks, scripts, or ETLs focused on specific concepts).
