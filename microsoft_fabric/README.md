# Microsoft Fabric

This section of the repository contains **hands-on projects built with Microsoft Fabric**, showcasing how to design, load, and transform data in a **modern data warehouse / lakehouse** environment.

Each project demonstrates a different scenario — from classic ETL migrations to cloud-scale analytics — using **Pipelines**, **Spark pools** and **Data Flow Gen2** across **bronze, silver, and gold** layers.

## Technologies involved

* Pipelines
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)
* Azure Data Factory / Pipelines
* SQL / T-SQL
* Parquet / Delta / External Tables
* Power BI (optional visualization)
* Azure SQL Database

## 🧠 Learning Focus

* Comparing Serverless vs Dedicated query performance.
* Using CTAS and external tables efficiently.
* Best practices for partitioning, naming conventions, and schema organization.
* Applying Medallion principles progressively as projects evolve.
